# Welcome to **ARIADNE**
This is the website belonging to the **ARIADNE** project.

# Who are we?
We are a group of early career researchers in the fields of biological psychology and neuroscience.

# What is this about?
We have created a curated resource navigator called **ARIADNE** that will guide researchers in the field of life sciences, especially those at the beginning of their career, through the process of conducting a transparent and reproducible research project from start to finish. The project is presented in the form of 10 steps, with tried-and-tested resources allocated to each step. You can find an outline of these 10 steps below:

1. Starting a project - from literature research to a research question
2. Planning and designing experiments - from ethics to sample size
3. Creating experiments - from task programming to stimulus control
4. Piloting and manipulation checks - from data simulation to preregistration
5. Collecting the data - from participant recruitment to testing
6. Validating the data -  from quality control to data curation
7. Analysing the data - from wrangling to the final results
8. Writing - from the scope to a finished manuscript draft
9. Publishing the results - from the cover letter to responding to reviewer comments
10. Disseminating the publication - from data sharing to science communication

These 10 steps determine the quality and ultimately the success of any research project, yet so far no such guide exists, especially none focussing on novel developments in the field of open and reproducible science practices.

# Introduction

A comparison between research projects conducted two decades ago and those of today reveals a marked increase in the demands placed upon early career researchers (ECRs; Weissgerber, 2021). This can be attributed, in part, to factors such as the need for larger sample sizes (e.g., big data; Fan et al., 2014; Marx, 2013; Zook et al., 2017), the incorporation of novel methods such as pre-registration or dissemination possibilities (Ross-Hellauer et al., 2020; Tripathy et al., 2017) and the growing utilization of advanced computational and statistical techniques (Bolt et al., 2021; Bzdok et al., 2017) such as machine learning, as well as the implementation of cutting-edge technologies such as virtual reality (Matthews, 2018). All of these factors contribute to an increased time commitment required to successfully undertake such research endeavors (Powell, 2016). Accordingly, the motivation and eagerness many ECRs feel during the first year of their research work is more and more often accompanied by feelings of being overwhelmed, as many project choices have to be made and a variety of skills have to be learned that determine the long-term success of one’s first research project. 

At this stage, most ECRs lack the necessary expertise and experience to make these important decisions. Moreover, many common terms need to be understood and learned. Learning this ‘language of science’ can be difficult for ECRs (Parsons et al., 2022, see also Table 1). In addition, institutions and supervisors often provide researchers with a relatively fixed array of available resources which are conventionally used, such as software subscriptions or in-house software. These tools are often expensive and bound to the institution itself (i.e. may become unavailable when the researcher changes institutions or works from home). On top of that, limited (subscription-based) resources might not only impede, but also prevent good scientific practice. Accordingly, many open access tools have been proposed as the solution for the accomplished ECR. However, these openly available resources are often spread out, hard to find or to compare with each other in terms of reliability, validity, usability, and practicality, and difficult to learn, in particular if there is no support by supervisors. Furthermore, these difficulties are time-consuming and create a potentially error-prone resource-maze, further exacerbating the uncertainty of how and with which tools to do high-quality science. 

Therefore, a comprehensive overview of tried-and-tested openly available resources that cover all parts of the research process is warranted. Here, we provide an overview of curated resources that are helpful to master the challenges associated with the research project (see also Figure 1 and exemplary resources marked with ➜ in the subsequent text). Our freely available and “living” tool called **ARIADNE** spans the whole research process, helps ECRs to identify and find relevant resources, and is available as a dynamic interface for easier use and searchability. In doing so, we put an emphasis on open and reproducible science practices, as these practices become more and more valued and even mandatory (Kent et al., 2022). In the following, we divide the research process into 10 steps that determine the quality and the success of research projects. We describe the challenges and choices to be made in each step and provide curated resources from **ARIADNE** in each of them: 1) project start, 2) study design, 3) study implementation, 4) piloting, 5) data collection, 6) data validation, 7) data analysis, 8) writing, 9) publication, and 10) dissemination. We also introduce key terms relevant in each step (see Table 1; for open science-related terms see Parsons et al., 2022), ultimately aiming to facilitate training and communication between experts and people starting out in the world of academia (Parsons et al., 2022). Lastly, we provide a checklist with questions one might ask at each step of a research project in Table 2.

| Power analysis                                                       | A statistical method used in research to determine the sample size needed for a study to achieve a desired level of statistical power. Statistical power refers to the ability of a study to detect a significant effect, or difference, between groups or conditions when a true effect or difference exists. Crucially, if a study is underpowered (i.e., the sample size is too small), then it may not be able to detect significant effects even if they are present. Conversely, if a study is overpowered (i.e., the sample size is too large), then resources may be wasted and the study may be unnecessarily expensive or time-consuming. | Kemal (2020)                                                                                                                     |
