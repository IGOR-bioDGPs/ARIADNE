# Welcome to **ARIADNE**
This is the website belonging to the **ARIADNE** project.

# Who are we?
We are a group of early career researchers in the fields of biological psychology and neuroscience.

# What is this about?
We have created a curated resource navigator called **ARIADNE** that will guide researchers in the field of life sciences, especially those at the beginning of their career, through the process of conducting a transparent and reproducible research project from start to finish. The project is presented in the form of 10 steps, with tried-and-tested resources allocated to each step. You can find an outline of these 10 steps below:

1. Starting a project - from literature research to a research question
2. Planning and designing experiments - from ethics to sample size
3. Creating experiments - from task programming to stimulus control
4. Piloting and manipulation checks - from data simulation to preregistration
5. Collecting the data - from participant recruitment to testing
6. Validating the data -  from quality control to data curation
7. Analysing the data - from wrangling to the final results
8. Writing - from the scope to a finished manuscript draft
9. Publishing the results - from the cover letter to responding to reviewer comments
10. Disseminating the publication - from data sharing to science communication

These 10 steps determine the quality and ultimately the success of any research project, yet so far no such guide exists, especially none focussing on novel developments in the field of open and reproducible science practices.
