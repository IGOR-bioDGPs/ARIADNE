| Corresponding author                                                 | The corresponding author is typically the researcher who takes primary responsibility for communication regarding the manuscript, during both pre-publication and post-publication phases. This usually includes communication with the publisher, the readers, and handling requests for data-sharing. Note that different journals may have different requirements for corresponding authors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Pain, 2021                                                                                                                       |
| Cover letter                                                         | A letter to the editor of a scientific journal that is submitted together with a manuscript. It outlines the importance of the study and summarizes key findings and contributions to the field. Some journals explicitly require such a letter, while others actively discourage it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Palminteri (2023)                                                                                                                |
| CRediT Statement                                                     | A taxonomy of 14 roles that can be assumed when being part of a research project. The statement can be included at the end of a manuscript to transparently report which author assumed which roles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Brand et al.

| Early career researcher                                              | An individual that is early in their academic career. Typically from graduate or PhD student to Postdoc level, sometimes even young principal investigators such as junior professors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Bazeley (2003); Laudel & Gläser (2008)                                                                                           |
| First author                                                         | The first author is the person listed first in an author list of a manuscript. In many fields, it is the person who has done most of the hands-on work and who has taken on a pivotal role in the research project. Shared co-first authorship is possible when two (or more) authors provided equal first-author-level contributions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Riesenberg (1990)                                                                                                                |
| Garden of Forking Paths / Researcher degrees of freedom              | Metaphor for the many (analytic) decisions that researchers can take, leading to many possible outcomes. The multitude of possible decisions can give rise to questionable measurement practices such as p-hacking or hypothesizing after the results are known (HARKing).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Gelman & Loken (2013); Botvinik-Nezer et al.

| h\-factor                                                            | A controversially discussed metric proposed by Hirsch (2005) to assess a researcher’s (or journal’s) scientific output by combining publication quantity and impact (i.e., citations). h is defined as the highest number of papers of an individual (or journal) with at least h citations (e.g., h = 3 means having 3 papers with at least 3 citations each).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Hirsch (2005)                                                                                                                    |
| Impact factor                                                        | A metric used to evaluate the relative importance of a scholarly journal in a particular field by measuring the average number of citations received per article published in that journal over a specific period of time. It is calculated by dividing the total number of citations a journal receives in a given year by the total number of articles published by the journal in the preceding two years and commonly used as a tool to assess the quality and significance of research, and has become an influential factor in the academic publishing industry, although it is controversially discussed.                                    | Sharma et al. (2014)                                                                                                             |
| Ivory tower                                                          | A metaphor for academia, portraying scientists as a group of closed-off individuals living in a tower and discussing scientific progress only amongst themselves, limiting the outreach of scientific results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Bond & Paterson (2005); Lewis, (2018)                                                                                            |

These costs are intended to cover processes associated with editing, peer-reviewing, and formatting; however, paradoxically, they limit dissemination and potentially hinder scientific progress. Hence, some researchers advocate for open access publishing models to promote equity in knowledge distribution.                                                                                                                            | Barbour et al.

| Peer review                                                          | The act of giving feedback on a manuscript under consideration at a scientific journal. Typically, a minimum of two reviewers that are experts in the field are invited to comment on a manuscript. Subsequently, editors make a decision whether to accept or reject the submission and authors can be asked to revise their work based on reviewers’ comments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Jana (2019)                                                                                                                      |
| Pilot study                                                          | A pilot study is a small-scale preliminary investigation that is conducted before a larger research project or study to test the feasibility of the research design, methods, and instruments. The primary purpose of a pilot study is to identify potential problems and areas for improvement in the research protocol, which can be rectified before conducting the actual study.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Arain et al.

| Postprint                                                            | The accepted or published version of a manuscript in a scientific journal. Postprints can often be shared on public repositories to make them accessible to everyone and forgo the “paywall”. Note that journal-specific policies (e.g., embargo periods) need to be considered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Harnad (2003)                                                                                                                    |
| Power analysis                                                       | A statistical method used in research to determine the sample size needed for a study to achieve a desired level of statistical power. Statistical power refers to the ability of a study to detect a significant effect (or difference) between groups or conditions when a true effect (or difference) exists. Crucially, if a study is underpowered (i.e., the sample size is too small), researchers may not be able to detect significant effects even if they are present. Conversely, if a study is overpowered (i.e., the sample size is too large), resources may be wasted and the study may be unnecessarily expensive or time-consuming.| Kemal (2020)                                                                                                                     |

It aims to refute or dispute opposing arguments by presenting counter-evidence or alternative interpretations or theories. Thus, rebuttals are an important aspect of peer review processes, which allows for the improvement of scientific work through constructive feedback or critical discourse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Palminteri (2023)                                                                                                                |
| Registered Report                                                    | A type of scholarly article format that involves a two-stage peer review process. In this format, authors submit a detailed research proposal or protocol to a journal, which is then peer-reviewed before any data is collected. If the proposal is deemed to be methodologically sound and potentially impactful, the journal agrees in advance to publish the results of the study, regardless of the outcome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Henderson & Chambers (2022)                                                                                                      |
