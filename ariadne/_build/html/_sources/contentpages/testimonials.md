> _"The Leibniz Institute for Psychology (ZPID) is the supra-regional research support facility for psychology in German-speaking countries. (...) From our perspective as an infrastructure institution, we recognize the need for tools like ARIADNE because it provides access to the many resources available to help researchers conduct transparent and reproducible research, which are otherwise difficult to discover and keep track of. It is our mission to support researchers in conducting open science, and as such, we would be pleased to support the ARIADNE team by featuring their curated resource navigator on ZPID’s [psychologie.de](https://psychologie.de/forschung/studien-durchfuehren/), thereby increasing its visibility. The current storage and maintenance solution of ARIADNE fulfills our quality standards given that the tool remains to be free-of-charge, version controlled, updateable, and flexible in terms of its content extension. Because the project lives in an organizational (as opposed to a personal or university-specific) GitHub account, maintenance is not tied to a single person or their employment at a particular institution, and can be transferred as the team sees fit."_

Prof. Dr. Kai Sassenberg - Director of the ZPID, in his letter of support for ARIADNE

> _"(...) I have followed the creation and development of ARIADNE with pleasure and am happy to support it in my role as speaker of the biopsychology section. The project is embedded in the DGPs interest group for Open and Reproducible Research (IGOR) and also hosted within this framework (on the GitHub account of the organization). The two current IGOR speakers and co-authors of the tool, Dr. Helena Hartmann and Dr. Gordon Feld, have committed to be responsible for the long-term maintenance of ARIADNE. I especially appreciate both the fact that this is a grassroots initiative from the IGOR members and that community members can contribute to the resource."_

> _"ARIADNE is an amazing resource. To be able to have so many (tried and tested) tools in one place is extremely useful. Considering that people come into science from different fields and with differing levels of knowledge it can certainly help to even the playing field."_

Clara Hartmann - PhD student in biology at VU Amsterdam

> _"ARIADNE is a great help for researchers, especially young scientists, to find their way through the jungle of possible tools and resources available for any kind of research. What I find particularly valuable is the ARIADNE community (guided by the DGPs interest group for Open and Reproducible Research, IGOR) and the process in which many different experts were and are involved. ARIADNE is an extremely helpful and creative work, transparent and open to new ideas but also questions directed to the scientific process in order to improve it."_

Prof. Dr. Anett Müller-Alcazar - Professor in biological psychology at Medical School Hamburg and an IGOR member
