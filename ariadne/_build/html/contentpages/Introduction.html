<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>A comparison between research projects conducted two decades ago and those of today reveals a marked increase in the demands placed upon <em>early career researchers</em> (ECRs; Weissgerber, 2021). This can be attributed, in part, to factors such as the need for larger sample sizes (Fan et al., 2014; Marx, 2013; Zook et al., 2017), the incorporation of novel methods such as pre-registration or dissemination possibilities (Ross-Hellauer et al., 2020; Tripathy et al., 2017), and the growing utilization of advanced computational and statistical techniques (Bolt et al., 2021; Bzdok et al., 2017) such as machine learning, as well as the implementation of cutting-edge technologies such as virtual reality (Matthews, 2018). All of these factors contribute to an increased time commitment required to successfully undertake such research endeavors (Powell, 2016). Accordingly, the motivation and eagerness many ECRs feel during the first year of their work is more and more often accompanied by feelings of being overwhelmed (Kismihók et al., 2022; Levecque et al., 2017), as many project choices have to be made and a variety of skills need to be learned that determine the long-term success of one’s first research project.</p>
<p>At this stage, most ECRs lack the necessary expertise and experience to make these important decisions. Moreover, many common terms need to be understood and learned. Learning this ‘language of science’ can be difficult for ECRs (Parsons et al., 2022; see also Table 1). In addition, institutions and supervisors often provide researchers with a relatively fixed array of available resources which are conventionally used, such as software subscriptions or in-house software. These tools are often expensive and bound to the institution itself (i.e., may become unavailable when the researcher changes institutions or works from home). On top of that, limited (subscription-based) resources might not only impede, but also prevent good scientific practice. Accordingly, many open access tools have been proposed to facilitate life as an ECR. However, these resources are often spread out and hard to find or to compare with each other in terms of reliability, validity, usability, and practicality. Moreover, these resources can be difficult to learn, in particular if there is limited support by supervisors. Taken together, these difficulties are time-consuming and create a (potentially error-prone) resource-labyrinth, further exacerbating the uncertainty of how, and with which tools, high-quality science can be achieved.</p>
<p>Therefore, a comprehensive overview of curated resources that cover all parts of a research project is warranted. To address this issue, we created <a class="reference external" href="https://igor-biodgps.github.io/ARIADNE/graph/graph.html"><strong>ARIADNE</strong></a> – a living and interactive resource navigator that helps to use and search a dynamically updated database of resources (see also Figure 1 and exemplary resources marked with ➜ in the subsequent text). We named our tool ARIADNE, as we aim to help ECRs navigate the ‘labyrinth’ of research tools and resources, much like the mythological Ariadne helped Theseus navigate the labyrinth (see e.g. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ariadne-Greek-mythology">here</a>). Our tool spans the whole research cycle, helps ECRs to identify and find relevant resources, and is available as a dynamic interface for easier use and searchability. The open-access database covers a constantly growing list of resources that are useful for each step of a research project, ranging from the planning and designing of study, over the collection and analysis of the data, to the writing and disseminating of findings. In doing so, we put an emphasis on open and reproducible science practices, as these practices become more and more valued and even mandatory (Kent et al., 2022). In the following, we divide the research cycle into 10 steps that determine the quality and the success of research projects. We describe the challenges and choices to be made in each step and provide curated resources from ARIADNE for each of them: 1) project start, 2) study design, 3) study implementation, 4) piloting, 5) data collection, 6) data validation, 7) data analysis, 8) writing, 9) publication, and 10) dissemination. We also introduce key terms relevant in each step , ultimately aiming to facilitate training and communication between experts and people starting out in the world of academia (see Table 1 and italicized words in the main text; for open science-related terms see Parsons et al., 2022). Lastly, we provide a checklist with questions one might ask at each step of a research project in Table 2.</p>

<tr class="row-even"><td><p>Paywall</p></td>
<td><p>A digital barrier implemented by academic publishers restricting access to scholarly content (e.g., articles) to researchers or institutions that have paid for a subscription (or a one-time access). These costs are intended to cover processes associated with editing, peer-reviewing, and formatting; however, paradoxically, they limit dissemination and potentially hinder scientific progress. Hence, some researchers advocate for open access publishing models to promote equity in knowledge distribution.</p></td>

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>Peer review</p></td>
<td><p>The act of giving feedback on a manuscript under consideration at a scientific journal. Typically, a minimum of two reviewers that are experts in the field are invited to comment on a manuscript. Subsequently, editors make a decision whether to accept or reject the submission and authors can be asked to revise their work based on reviewers’ comments.</p></td>

<tr class="row-even"><td><p>Pilot study</p></td>
<td><p>A pilot study is a small-scale preliminary investigation that is conducted before a larger research project or study to test the feasibility of the research design, methods, and instruments. The primary purpose of a pilot study is to identify potential problems and areas for improvement in the research protocol, which can be rectified before conducting the actual study.</p></td>

<tr class="row-even"><td><p>Power analysis</p></td>
<td><p>A statistical method used in research to determine the sample size needed for a study to achieve a desired level of statistical power. Statistical power refers to the ability of a study to detect a significant effect (or difference) between groups or conditions when a true effect (or difference) exists. Crucially, if a study is underpowered (i.e., the sample size is too small), researchers may not be able to detect significant effects even if they are present. Conversely, if a study is overpowered (i.e., the sample size is too large), resources may be wasted and the study may be unnecessarily expensive or time-consuming.</p></td>

<td><p>A version of a manuscript that has not yet been peer-reviewed and published in a scientific journal, but is uploaded to an open-access online repository, usually at the time of submission to a journal. Since preprints did not undergo the established scientific quality-control process (i.e., peer review), preprints usually include a brief note that the reported findings should be examined with caution by practitioners, journalists, and policymakers.</p></td>

<tr class="row-even"><td><p>Rebuttal</p></td>
<td><p>A written response to a criticism made against a research manuscript or proposal. It aims to refute or dispute opposing arguments by presenting counter-evidence or alternative interpretations or theories. Thus, rebuttals are an important aspect of peer review processes, which allows for the improvement of scientific work through constructive feedback or critical discourse.</p></td>

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>Registered Report</p></td>
<td><p>A type of scholarly article format that involves a two-stage peer review process. In this format, authors submit a detailed research proposal or protocol to a journal, which is then peer-reviewed before any data is collected. If the proposal is deemed to be methodologically sound and potentially impactful, the journal agrees in advance to publish the results of the study, regardless of the outcome.</p></td>
