# Introduction

A comparison between research projects conducted two decades ago and those of today reveals a marked increase in the demands placed upon _early career researchers_ (ECRs; Weissgerber, 2021). This can be attributed, in part, to factors such as the need for larger sample sizes (Fan et al., 2014; Marx, 2013; Zook et al., 2017), the incorporation of novel methods such as pre-registration or dissemination possibilities (Ross-Hellauer et al., 2020; Tripathy et al., 2017), and the growing utilization of advanced computational and statistical techniques (Bolt et al., 2021; Bzdok et al., 2017) such as machine learning, as well as the implementation of cutting-edge technologies such as virtual reality (Matthews, 2018). All of these factors contribute to an increased time commitment required to successfully undertake such research endeavors (Powell, 2016). Accordingly, the motivation and eagerness many ECRs feel during the first year of their work is more and more often accompanied by feelings of being overwhelmed (Kismihók et al., 2022; Levecque et al., 2017), as many project choices have to be made and a variety of skills need to be learned that determine the long-term success of one’s first research project.  

At this stage, most ECRs lack the necessary expertise and experience to make these important decisions. Moreover, many common terms need to be understood and learned. Learning this ‘language of science’ can be difficult for ECRs (Parsons et al., 2022; see also Table 1). In addition, institutions and supervisors often provide researchers with a relatively fixed array of available resources which are conventionally used, such as software subscriptions or in-house software. These tools are often expensive and bound to the institution itself (i.e., may become unavailable when the researcher changes institutions or works from home). On top of that, limited (subscription-based) resources might not only impede, but also prevent good scientific practice. Accordingly, many open access tools have been proposed to facilitate life as an ECR. However, these resources are often spread out and hard to find or to compare with each other in terms of reliability, validity, usability, and practicality. Moreover, these resources can be difficult to learn, in particular if there is limited support by supervisors. Taken together, these difficulties are time-consuming and create a (potentially error-prone) resource-labyrinth, further exacerbating the uncertainty of how, and with which tools, high-quality science can be achieved.

# The Resource

Therefore, a comprehensive overview of curated resources that cover all parts of a research project is warranted. To address this issue, we created [**ARIADNE**](https://igor-biodgps.github.io/ARIADNE/graph/graph.html) – a living and interactive resource navigator that helps to use and search a dynamically updated database of resources (see also Figure 1 and exemplary resources marked with ➜ in the subsequent text). We named our tool ARIADNE, as we aim to help ECRs navigate the 'labyrinth' of research tools and resources, much like the mythological Ariadne helped Theseus navigate the labyrinth (see e.g. [here](https://doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780199381135.013.722). Our tool spans the whole research cycle, helps ECRs to identify and find relevant resources, and is available as a dynamic interface for easier use and searchability. The open-access database covers a constantly growing list of resources that are useful for each step of a research project, ranging from the planning and designing of study, over the collection and analysis of the data, to the writing and disseminating of findings. In doing so, we put an emphasis on open and reproducible science practices, as these practices become more and more valued and even mandatory (Kent et al., 2022). 

Our step-by-step graphical interface to [ARIADNE](https://igor-biodgps.github.io/ARIADNE/graph/graph.html) including detailed usage instructions and the corresponding source code is freely available [online](https://github.com/IGOR-bioDGPs/ARIADNE). The tool is divided into two sections: a web-hosted [Jupyter Book](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.2561065) detailing the aforementioned steps and a Cytoscape network showcasing the steps dynamically and interactively. We selected this framework due to the robust capabilities offered by GitHub for project management, development, and deployment within a single platform. By combining Jupyter Books with GitHub's integrated web hosting, our online book is freely accessible. Additionally, GitHub Pages can host tools generated via JavaScript backend. We have exploited this feature to develop our network tool using a [Cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org/) (Franz et al., 2016) backend. Furthermore, we have secured the backend by locally hosting the Cytoscape.js instance within our project's repository. This approach safeguards the project from potential disruptions caused by significant changes in the Cytoscape.js backend, as we maintain our own copy of the Cytoscape.js instance.

Moreover, through issues and pull requests, users of our tool can contribute future updates, ideas, new resources, and bug fixes. Therefore, we confidently characterize our tool as a community-driven and open-source" tool. In the fast-paced realm of research, where new tools are frequently introduced, the imperative of being "community-driven" is effectively met through the myriad opportunities afforded by GitHub.

ARIADNE is supported by the Leibniz Institute for Psychology ([ZPID](https://leibniz-psychology.org/)) and the Interest Group for Open and Reproducible Science ([IGOR](https://www.dgps.de/fachgruppen/fgbi/aktivitaeten-der-fachgruppe/igor/)) of the section Biological Psychology and Neuropsychology, which forms part of the German Psychological Society (DGPs). This community-driven resource is thus embedded in organizational structures of Psychology in Germany who will aid with long-term storage and scaling plans going forward. 

In the following, we divide the research cycle into 10 steps that determine the quality and the success of research projects. We describe the challenges and choices to be made in each step and provide curated resources from ARIADNE for each of them: 1) project start, 2) study design, 3) study implementation, 4) piloting, 5) data collection, 6) data validation, 7) data analysis, 8) writing, 9) publication, and 10) dissemination. We also introduce key terms relevant in each step , ultimately aiming to facilitate training and communication between experts and people starting out in the world of academia (see Table 1 and italicized words in the main text; for open science-related terms see Parsons et al., 2022). Lastly, we provide a checklist with questions one might ask at each step of a research project in Table 2.
