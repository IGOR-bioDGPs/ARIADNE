| Garden of Forking Paths / Researcher degrees of freedom              | Metaphor for the many (analytic) decisions that researchers can take, leading to many possible outcomes.

| Impact factor                                                        | A metric used to evaluate the relative importance of a scholarly journal in a particular field by measuring the average number of citations received per article published in that journal over a specific period of time. It is calculated by dividing the total number of citations a journal receives in a given year by the total number of articles published by the journal in the preceding two years and commonly used as a tool to assess the quality and significance of research, and has become an influential factor in the academic publishing industry, although it is controversially discussed.                                    | Sharma et al.

The primary purpose of a pilot study is to identify potential problems and areas for improvement in the research protocol, which can be rectified before conducting the actual study.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Arain et al.

Statistical power refers to the ability of a study to detect a significant effect (or difference) between groups or conditions when a true effect (or difference) exists.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Kemal (2020)                                                                                                                     |

Since preprints did not undergo the established scientific quality-control process (i.e., peer review), preprints usually include a brief note that the reported findings should be examined with caution by practitioners, journalists, and policymakers. Please note that preprint servers can also include postprints (see term definition above).                                                                                     | Hoy (2020); Wingen et al.

It aims to refute or dispute opposing arguments by presenting counter-evidence or alternative interpretations or theories. Thus, rebuttals are an important aspect of peer review processes, which allows for the improvement of scientific work through constructive feedback or critical discourse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Palminteri (2023)                                                                                                                |

In this format, authors submit a detailed research proposal or protocol to a journal, which is then peer-reviewed before any data is collected. If the proposal is deemed to be methodologically sound and potentially impactful, the journal agrees in advance to publish the results of the study, regardless of the outcome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Henderson & Chambers (2022)                                                                                                      |

In other words, it is the likelihood of obtaining a statistically significant result by chance alone, without any true underlying effect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Banerjee et al.
