# Acknowledgements

We thank the Interest Group for Open and Reproducible Science ([IGOR](https://www.dgps.de/fachgruppen/fgbi/aktivitaeten-der-fachgruppe/igor/)) of the section Biological Psychology and Neuropsychology, which forms part of the German Psychological Society (DGPs), as well as the [ZPID](https://leibniz-psychology.org/en/) (Public Open Science Institute for Psychology) for supporting this tool going forward. 

The idea for this tool originated in an online IGOR hackathon in late 2022 and was developed through regular online meetings and asynchronous work. We started out with an extensive Miro board and quickly moved to the current version of the tool, as more resources were added. Resources were crowdsourced by the team with the help of the IGOR community and beyond. 

We thank Julius Welzel for supplying new glossary terms in the revision process.
